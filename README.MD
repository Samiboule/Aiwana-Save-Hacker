#Savehacker

This project is supposed to make savehacking for most studio games accessible.
In the future I might consider adding support for other types of games.

##Usage guide
Double click the exe and follow the instructions.
You can also use command line arguments to skip the initial step.

##TODO
- Add support for more games (GM8?)
- Clean up the code (hopefully I do this)
- Make it more user friendly (multiline json, command line arguments, etc)
- Actual error catching (little experience with this so we'll see)
- Write documentation and comments in the code
- Iron out some of the quirks (For example: already having a .bak in the directory causes a crash)
- Listen to feedback
- Release the tool (this is isn't necessarily todo but it's something to consider)
